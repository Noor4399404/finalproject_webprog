Scotland Yard

Oscar, Bj√∂rn, Dennis en Noor 

For this assignment we had to digitalise a modern game. 
This game had to be played by two people and more. 
We chose the game: Scotland Yard.

To play this game with multiple people, one person has to be the host.
That person will copy the id number and give it to the other players.
These players will join the game with this id number.
The host will choose who will be Mister X, and will then start the game. 

The players are not able to see Mister X, only after a certain amount of moves.
There need to be 4 or 5 players to start the game.
The rules of the game are explained on the page of the website called: "How to play".

We have tried to put the game online: 

https://londondetectivegame.000webhostapp.com/

But we encountered some problems when playing it on here.
It is possible to play the game flawlessly on the localhost. 

Good luck with playing!
